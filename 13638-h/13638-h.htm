<h2>OUR PROGRESS</h2>
<p>Although very unwilling to encroach upon the enlarged space
which we have this week afforded to our numerous and increasing
contributors, we may be permitted to refer to the fact of our
having felt it due to them to find such additional space by giving
an extra half-sheet, as a proof at once of the growing interest in
our Journal, and of its extended utility.</p>
<p>We trust too that the step which we have thus taken will be
received as a pledge of our intention to meet all the requirements
which may arise from our Journal becoming more generally known, and
consequently, as we are justified by our past experience in saying,
being made greater use of, as a medium of intercommunication
between all classes of students and men of letters.</p>
<p>Our last and present Number furnish proofs of its utility in a
way which when it was originally projected could scarcely have been
contemplated. We allude to its being made the channel through which
intending editors may announce the works on which they are engaged,
and invite the co-operation of their literary brethren. Nor is the
readiness with which such co-operation is likely to be afforded,
the only good result to be obtained by such an announcement. For
such an intimation is calculated not only to prevent the
unpleasantness likely to arise from a collision of
interests&mdash;but also to prevent a literary man either setting
to himself an unprofitable task or wasting his time and research
upon ground which is already occupied.</p>
<p>One word more. When we commenced our labours we were warned by
more than one friendly voice, that, although we should probably
find no lack of Queries, we should oftentimes be "straited for a
Reply." This, however, as our readers will admit, has not been the
case; for though, as Shakspeare says, with that truth and wisdom
for which he is proverbial&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The ample proposition that Hope makes,</p>
<p>In all designs begun on earth below,</p>
<p>Fails in its promis'd largeness,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the observation in our Introduction, that "those who are best
informed are generally most ready to communicate knowledge, and to
confess ignorance, to feel the value of such a work as we are
attempting, and to understand that if it is to be well done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id=
"page290"></a>{290}</span> they must help to do it," has, thanks to
the kind assistance of our friends, grown, from a mere statement of
opinion, to the dignity of a prediction. We undertook our task in
faith and hope, determined to do our best to realize the intentions
we had proposed to ourselves, and encouraged by the feeling that if
we did so labour, our exertions would not be in vain,
for&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"What poor duty cannot do,</p>
<p>Noble respect takes it in might not merit."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the success with which our efforts have been crowned shows
we were justified in so doing. And so, gentle reader, to the
banquet of dainty delights which is here spread before you!</p>
<hr />
<h3>CAPTIVITY OF THE QUEEN OF BRUCE IN ENGLAND.</h3>
<p>I perceive, in one of the recent interesting communications made
to the "NOTES AND QUERIES," by the Rev. Lambert B. Larking, that he
has given, from a wardrobe roll in the Surrenden collection, a
couple of extracts, which show that Bruce's Queen was in 1314 in
the custody of the Abbess of Barking. To that gentleman our thanks
are due for the selection of documents which had escaped the
careful researches of Lysons, and which at once throw light on the
personal history of a royal captive, and illustrate the annals of a
venerable Abbey. I am glad to be able to answer the concluding
query as to the exact date when the unfortunate lady, (Bruce's
second wife,) left that Abbey, and to furnish a few additional
particulars relative to her eight years' imprisonment in England.
History relates that in less than three months after the crown had
been placed upon the head of Bruce by the heroic Countess of
Buchan, sister of the Earl of Fife (29th March, 1306), he was
attacked and defeated at Methven, near Perth, by the English, under
Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. After this signal discomfiture,
the king fled into the mountains, accompanied by a few faithful
followers: his Queen, daughter, and several other ladies, for
awhile shared his misfortunes and dangers; but they at length took
refuge at the Castle of Kildrummie, from whence they retreated, in
the hope of greater security, to the sanctuary of St. Duthae, at
Tain, in Ross-shire. The Earl of Ross, it is said, violated the
sanctuary, and delivered the party up to the English, who (as sings
Chaucer's contemporary, Barbour, in his not very <i>barbarous</i>
Scottish dialect) straightway proceeded to</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;"put the laydis in presoune,</p>
<p>Sum in till castell, sum in dongeoun."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Among the captives were three ecclesiastics, who had taken a
prominent part at the king's coronation&mdash;the Bishops of
Glasgow and St. Andrews and the Abbot of Scone, arrayed in most
uncanonical costume.<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Peter
Langtoft pathetically bewails their misfortune:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The Bisshop of Saynt Andrew, and the Abbot of</p>
<p class="i4">Scone,</p>
<p class="i2">The Bisshop of Glascow, thise were taken sone;</p>
<p class="i2">Fettred on hackneis, to Inlond ere thei sent,</p>
<p class="i2">On sere stedis it seis, to prison mad present."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An instrument in Norman French, printed in Rymer's great
collection (<i>Foedera</i>, vol. i. part ii. p. 994, new ed.),
directs the manner in which the prisoners were to be treated. As
this document is curious, I will give that portion which refers
particularly to Bruce's wife, the "Countess of Carrick:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A.D. 1306. (34 Edw. 1.) Fait a remembrer, qi, quant la Femme le
Conte de Carrik sera venue au Roi, ele soit envee a
<i>Brustewik</i> [on Humber], &amp; qe ele eit tieu mesnee, &amp;
sa sustenance ordenee en la manere desouz escrite: cest
asavoir,</p>
<p>"Qe ele eit deux femmes du pays oversqe li; cest asaver, une
damoisele &amp; une femme por sa chambre, qi soient bien d'age
&amp; nyent gayes, &amp; qi eles soient de bon &amp; meur port; les
queles soient entendantz, a li por li servir:</p>
<p>"Et deux vadletz, qi soient ausint bien d'age, &amp; avisez, de
queux l'un soit un des vadletz le Conte de Ulvestier [the Earl of
Ulster, her father], cest asaver Johan de Benteley, ou autre qil
mettra en lieu de li, &amp; l'autre acun du pays, qi soit por
trencher devant li:</p>
<p>"Et ausant eit ele un garzon a pee, por demorer en sa chambre,
tiel qi soit sobre, &amp; ne mie riotous, por son lit faire, &amp;
por autres choses qe covendront por sa chambre:</p>
<p>"Et, estre ce, ordenez est qeele eit un Vadlet de mestier, qe
soit de bon port, &amp; avisez, por port ses cleifs, por panetrie,
&amp; botellerie, &amp; un cu:</p>
<p>"Et ele deit ausint aver trois leveriers, por aver son deduyt en
la garrene illueques, &amp; en les pares, quant ele voudra:</p>
<p>"Et qe ele eit de la veneison, &amp; du peisson es pescheries,
selene ce qe master li sera:</p>
<p>"Et qe ele gisse en la plus bele maison du manoir a sa volunte:
Et, qe ele voit guyer es pares, r'aillois entor le manoir, a se
volunte."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These orders are apparently not more severe than was necessary
for the safe custody of the Queen; and, considering the date of
their issue, they seem to be lenient, considerate, and indulgent.
Not so, however, with the unfortunate Countess of Buchan, who was
condemned to be encaged in a turret of Berwick Castle ("en une
<i>kage</i> de fort latiz, de fuist &amp; barrez, &amp; bien
efforcez de ferrement;" <i>i.e.</i> of strong lattice-work of wood,
barred, and well strengthened with iron<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>), where
she remained immured seven years. Bruce's <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>{291}</span> daughter,
Marjory, and his sister Mary, were likewise to be encaged, the
former in the Tower of London, the latter in Roxburghe Castle. The
young Earl of Mar, "L'enfant qi est heir de Mar," Bruce's nephew,
was to be sent to Bristol Castle, to be carefully guarded, "qil ne
puisse eshcaper en nule manere," but not to be
<i>fettered</i>&mdash;"mais q'il soit hors de fers, <i>tant come il
est de si tendre age</i>."</p>
<p>In 1308 (1 Edw. 2.), the Bailiff of Brustwick is commanded to
deliver up his prisoner, to be removed elsewhere, but to what place
it does not appear. A writ of the 6th Feb. 1312, directs her to be
conveyed to Windsor Castle, "cum familia sua." In October of the
same year, she was removed to "Shaston" (Shaftesbury), and
subsequently to the Abbey of Barking, where she remained till
March, 1314, when she was sent to Rochester Castle, as appears by
the following writ (Rymer, vol. ii. part i. p. 244.):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(7 Edw. 2.) <i>De ducendo Elizabetham uxorem Roberti de Brus,
usque ad Castrum Rossense.</i></p>
<p>"Mandatum est Vicecomitibus London quod Elizabetham. Uxorem

<p>But the day of deliverance was close at hand: the battle of
Bannockburn, so fatal to the English, was fought on the 24th June;
and on the 2nd of October the Constable of Rochester Castle is
commanded to conduct the wife, sister, and daughter of Robert Bruce
to Carlisle (<i>usque Karliolum</i>), where an exchange of
prisoners was made. Old Hector Boece, who, if Erasmus can be
trusted, "knew not to lie," informs us, that "King Robertis wife,

<h3>A NOTE ON ROBERT HERICK, AUTHOR OF "HESPERIDES."</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1844, I visited Dean Prior in company with my
brother, in order to ascertain if we could add any new fact to the
scanty accounts of the <i>Life of Herrick</i> recorded by his
biographers. The events of his life have been related by Dr. Drake,
(<i>Literary Hours</i>, vol. iii., 1st edit. 1798.&mdash;3rd edit.
1804), by Mr. Campbell, by Dr. Nott (<i>Select Poems from the
Hesperides</i>, &amp;c. Bristol, 1810,) by a writer in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. iv. 1810, by Mr. Wilmott in his
elegantly written <i>Lives of Sacred Poets</i>, vol. i., 1834, and
in the memoirs prefixed to the recent editions of <i>Herrick's
Poems</i> published by Clarke (1844), and Pickering (1846). On
examining any of these biographies, it will be found that the year
and place of Herrick's death have not been ascertained. This was
the point which I therefore particularly wished to inquire
into.</p>
<p>Dean Prior is a village about six or seven miles from Totnes:
the church, with the exception of the tower, had been recently
rebuilt. The monuments and inscribed stones were carefully removed
when the old fabric was taken down, and restored as nearly as could
be to corresponding situations in the new building. I sought in
vain, amongst these, for the name of Herrick. On making inquiry of
the old sexton who accompanied us, he said at first in a very
decided tone, "Oh, he died in Lunnun," but afterwards corrected
himself, and said that Herrick died at Dean Prior, and that an old
tombstone in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id=
"page292"></a>{292}</span> the churchyard, at the right hand side
of the walk leading to the south side of the church, which was
removed several years ago, was supposed to have covered the remains
of the former vicar of Dean Prior.</p>
<p>Being baffled in our search after "tombstone information," we
called at the vicarage, which stands close by the church, and the
vicar most courteously accorded us permission to search the
registers of the marriages, births, and burials, which were in his
custody. The portion of the dilapidated volume devoted to the
burials is headed thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dean Prior</p>
<p>"The names of all those y't have been buried in y'e same parish
from y'e year of our Lord God 1561, and so forwards."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some careful search we were gratified by discovering the
following entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Robert Herrick Vicker was buried y'e 15th day October,
1674."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fancy I met with a selection from <i>Herrick's Poems</i>
edited by <i>Mr. Singer</i>, several years ago, comprised in a
small neat volume. Can any of your readers inform me whether there
is such a book? I possess Mr. Singer's valuable editions of
<i>Cavendish</i>, <i>More</i>, and <i>Hall's Satires</i>, and would
wish to place this volume on the same shelf.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF "L&AElig;RIG?"</h3>
<p>This <i>query</i>, evidently addressed to our Anglo-Saxon
scholars by the distinguished philologist to whom we are all so
much indebted, not having been hitherto replied to, perhaps the
journal of "NOTES AND QUERIES" is the most fitting vehicle for this
suggestive note:&mdash;</p>
<p>TO DR. JACOB GRIMM.</p>
<p>Allow me, though an entire stranger to you, to thank you for the
pleasure I have derived, in common with all ethnological students,
from your very valuable labours, and especially from the
<i>Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache</i>. At the same time I
venture, with much diffidence, to offer a reply to your question
which occur in that work at p. 663.:&mdash;"Was heisst
<i>l&aelig;rig</i>?"</p>
<p>Lye says, "H&aelig;c vox occurrit apid C&aelig;dm. At
interpretatio ejus minime liquet." In the Supplement to his
Dictionary it is explained "docilis, tyro!" Mr. Thorpe, in his
<i>Analecta A.-S.</i> (1st edit. Gloss), says, "The meaning of this
word is uncertain: it occurs again in <i>C&aelig;dmon</i>;" and in
his translation of <i>C&aelig;dmon</i> he thus renders the
passage:&mdash;"Ofer linde l&aelig;rig=over the linden shields."
Here then <i>l&aelig;rig</i>, evidently an adjective, is rendered
by the substantive <i>shields</i>; and <i>linde</i>, evidently a
substantive, is rendered by the adjective <i>linden</i>. In two
other passages, Mr. Thorpe more correctly translates
<i>lindum</i>=bucklers.</p>
<p><i>Lind</i>, which Lye explained by the Latin <i>labarium</i>,
<i>vexillum</i>, that excellent scholar, the late lamented Mr.
Price, was the first, I believe, to show frequently signified <i>a
shield</i>; which was, probably for lightness, made of the wood of
the <i>lime tree</i>, and covered with skin, or leather of various
colours. Thus we have "sealwe linde" and "hwite linde" in
<i>C&aelig;dm.</i>, "geolwe linde" in <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>
<p>All this is superfluous to you, sir, I know&mdash;"<i>Retournons
&agrave; nos moutons</i>," as Maistre Pierre Pathelin says.</p>
<p>The sense required in the passage in <i>Brythnoth</i> seems to
me to be:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"b&aelig;rst bordes l&aelig;rig=the empty (hollow concave)
shields</p>
<p>"and seo byrne sang=and the armour (<i>lorica</i>)
resounded."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in <i>C&aelig;dmon</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ofer linde l&aelig;rig=over the empty (hollow concave)
shield."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Judith, <i>Th. Anal.</i> 137, 53. we have a similar
epithet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"hwealfum lindum=vaulted (arched concave) shields."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should remember that Somner has <i>ge-l&aelig;r</i>, void,
empty, <i>vacuus</i>; and Lye, with a reference to the Herbarium,
<i>l&aelig;r-nesse</i>, vacuitas. In the <i>Teuthonista</i> we have
<i>l&aelig;r</i>, vacuus, <i>concavus</i>. In <i>Heiland</i>, 3, 4.
"<i>larea</i> stodun thar stenuatu sehsi=<i>empty</i> stood there
stone-vats six." I need not call to your mind the O.H.G.
<i>l&aacute;ri</i>.</p>
<p>I think, therefore, we cannot doubt that what is intended to be
expressed by the A.-S. <i>l&aelig;rig</i> is <i>empty</i>,
<i>hollow</i>, <i>concave</i>. But if we wanted further
confirmation, <i>leer</i>, <i>leery</i>, <i>leary</i> are still in
use in Devonshire, Dorsetshire, and perhaps elsewhere, for
<i>empty</i>, <i>hollow</i>, as the provincial Glossaries will
show. Skinner has the word <i>leer</i>, vacuus, and says,
"foeliciter alludit Gr. [Greek: lagaros], laxus, vacuus." In
<i>Layamon</i> we have (244, 16.), "the put w&aelig;s
<i>i-l&aelig;r</i>." I have found but one instance in Middle
English, and that is in the curious old <i>Phrase-Book</i> compiled
by William Horman, Head Master of Eton School in the reign of Henry
VIII:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'At a soden shyfte <i>leere</i> barellis, tyed together, with
boardis above, make passage over a streme.' Tumultuario opere,
<i>inanes</i> cupp&aelig; colligat&aelig; et tabulatis
instrat&aelig; fluminis transitu perhibent."&mdash;<i>Hormanni
Vulgaria</i>, Lond. 1519, f. 272 b.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instances of the word are not frequent, possibly because we had
another word for empty (<i>toom</i>) in common with the Danes; but
perhaps there was no necessity for dwelling upon it in the sense of
<i>empty</i>; it was only its application as an epithet to a
<i>concave</i> or <i>hollow shield</i> that your question could
have had in view.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id=
"page293"></a>{293}</span>
<p>Once more thanking you most heartily for the pleasure and profit
I have derived from the <i>Deutsche Grammatik</i>, and all your
other important labours, I am, sir, your grateful and obliged
servant,</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<h4>ST. VALENTINE IN NORWICH&mdash;COOK-EELS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</h4>
<p>The day appropriated to St. Valentine is kept with some
peculiarity in the city of Norwich. Although "Valentines," as
generally understood, that is to say billets sent by means of the
post, are as numerously employed here as in other places, yet the
<i>custom</i> consists not in the transmission of a missive
overflowing with hearts and darts, or poetical posies, but in
something far more substantial, elegant and costly&mdash;to wit, a
goodly present of value unrestricted in use or expense. Though this
custom is openly adopted among relatives and others whose
friendship is reciprocated, yet the secret mode of placing a friend
in possession of an offering is followed largely,&mdash;and this it
is curious to remark, not on the <i>day</i> of the saint, when it
might be supposed that the appropriateness of the gift would be
duly ratified, the virtue of the season being in full vigour, but
on the <i>eve</i> of St. Valentine, when it is fair to presume his
charms are not properly matured. The mode adopted among all classes
is that of placing the presents on the door-sill of the house of
the favoured person, and intimating what is done by a run-a-way
knock or ring as the giver pleases.</p>
<p>So universal is this custom in this ancient city, that it may be
stated with truth some thousands of pounds are annually expended in
the purchase of Valentine presents. At the time of writing
(February 2.) the shops almost generally exhibit displays of
articles calculated for the approaching period, unexampled in
brilliancy, taste and costliness, and including nearly every item
suitable to the drawing room, the parlour, or the boudoir. The
local papers contain numerous advertising announcements of
"Valentines;" the walls are occupied with printed placards of a
similar character, and the city crier, by means of a loud bell and
an equally sonorous voice, proclaims the particular advantages in
the Valentine department of rival emporiums. All these preparations
increase as the avator of St. Valentine approaches. At length the
saint and his eve arrives&mdash;passes&mdash;and the custom,
apparently expanding with age, is placed in abeyance until the next
year. I am inclined to believe that this mode of keeping St.
Valentine is confined to this city and the county of Norfolk.</p>
<p>As regards priority of occurrence this year, I should have first
mentioned, that on Shrove Tuesday a custom commences of eating a
small bun called
cocque'els&mdash;cook-eels&mdash;coquilles&mdash;(the name being
spelt indifferently) which is continued through the season of Lent.
Forby, in his <i>Vocabulary of East Anglia</i>, calls this
production "a sort of cross bun," but no cross is placed upon it,
though its composition is not dissimilar. My inquiries, and, I may
add, my reading, have not led me to the origin of either of the
customs now detailed (with the exception of a few unsatisfactory
words given by Forby on cook-eels), and I should be glad to find
these brief notices leading by your means to more extended
information on both subjects, not only as regards this part of the
country, but others also.</p>
<p class="author">JOHN WODDERSPOON.</p>
<p>Norwich.</p>
<p><i>Old Charms.</i>&mdash;I think that, if you are anxious to
accumulate as much as you can of the Folk Lore of England, no set
of men are more likely to help you than the clergy, particularly
the younger part, viz., curates, to whom the stories they hear
among their flock have the gloss of novelty. I send you a specimen
of old charms, &amp;c. that have come under my notice in the
south-eastern counties.</p>
<p>No. 1. is a dialogue between the Parson and the old
Dame:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>P.</i> Well, Dame Grey, I hear you have a charm to cure the
toothache. Come, just let me hear it; I should be so much pleased
to know it.</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>. Oh, your reverence, it's not worth telling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Here a long talk&mdash;Parson coaxing the Dame to tell
him&mdash;old lady very shy, partly suspecting he is quizzing her,
partly that no charms are proper things, partly willing to know
what he thinks about it.) At last it ends by her saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, your reverence, you have been very kind to me, and I'll
tell you: it's just a verse from Scripture as I says over those as
have the toothache:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'And Jesus said unto Peter, What aileth thee? and Peter
answered, Lord, I have toothache. And the Lord healed him.'"</p>
<p>"<i>P.</i> Well, but Dame Grey, I think I know my Bible, and I
don't find any such verse in it."</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>. Yes, your reverence, that is just the charm.
<i>It's in the Bible</i>, but <i>you can't find it</i>!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. 2. To avert sickness from a family, hang up a sickle, or
iron implement, at the bed head.</p>
<p>No. 3. Should a death happen in a house at night, and there be a
hive or hives of bees in the garden, go out and wake them up at
once, otherwise the whole hive or swarm will die.</p>
<p>I hope your Folk Lore is not confined to the fading memorials of
a past age. The present superstitions are really much more
interesting and valuable to be gathered together; and I am sure
your pages would be very well employed in recording these for a
future generation. I would <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"
id="page294"></a>{294}</span> suggest, in all humility, that it
would be really useful, for the rulers of our Church and State, to
know how far such a superstition as the following prevails among
the peasantry:</p>
<p>That, if a dying person sees "glory," or a bright light, at or
near the time of their dissolution, such a vision is a sure sign of
their salvation, whatever may have been their former life, or their
repentance.</p>
<p class="author">D. Sholbus.</p>
<p><i>Superstitions in North of England.</i>&mdash;I find some
curious popular superstitions prevalent in the north of England
some three centuries ago recorded in the <i>Proceedings before the
Special Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes appointed by Queen
Elizabeth</i>. Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anthony Haggen presented for medicioning children with miniting
a hammer as a smythe of kynde."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"John Watson presented for burying a quick dogg and a quick
cowe."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Agnes, the wyf of John Wyse, als Winkam John Wyse, presented to
be a medicioner for the waffc of an yll wynde, and for the
fayryes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of your readers may perhaps explain what these were. It is
clear that they were superstitious practices of sufficient
prevalence and influence on the popular mind to call for the
interference of the queen's commissioners.</p>
<p class="author">A.B.</p>
<p><i>Decking Churches with Yew on Easter Day.</i>&mdash;In the
village of Berkely near Frome, Somerset, and on the borders of
Wiltshire, the church is decorated on Easter Sunday with yew,
evidently as an emblem of the Resurrection. Flowers in churches on
that day are common, but I believe the use of yew to be
unusual.</p>
<p class="author">W. Durrant Cooper.</p>
<p><i>Strewing Straw or Chaff.</i>&mdash;The custom mentioned by
your correspondent "B." (p. 245.) as prevailing in Gloucestershire,
is not peculiar to that county. In Kent, it is commonly practised
by the rustics. The publican, all the world over, decorates his
sign-board with a foaming can and pipes, to proclaim the
entertainment to be found within. On the same principle, these
rustics hang up <i>their</i> sign-board,&mdash;as one of them, with
whom I was once remonstrating, most graphically explained to me.
When they knew of a house where the master deems a little wholesome
discipline necessary to ensure the obedience of love, considering
it a pity that the world should be ignorant of his manly virtues,
they strew "well threshed" chaff or straw before his door, as an
emblematical sign-board, to proclaim that the sweet fare and "good
entertainment" of a "well threshed" article may be found within.
The custom, at all events, has one good tendency, it shames the
tyrant into restraint, when he knows that his cowardly practices
are patent to the world.</p>

<hr />
<h3>FOLK LORE OF WALES.</h3>
<p>No. 1. <i>Cron Annwn</i>.&mdash;When a storm sounds over the
mountains, the Welsh peasant will tell you that his ear discerns
the howl of the <i>Cron Annwn</i> mingling with that of the wind,
yet as clearly distinct from it as is the atmosphere in a
diving-bell from that of the surrounding waters. These dogs of
Annwn, or "couriers of the air," are spirit hounds, who hunt the
souls of the dead; or, as occasionally said, they foretell, by
their expectant cries, the approaching death of some man of evil
deeds. Few have ever pretended to see them; for few, we presume,
would linger until they dawned on the sight; but they are described
by Taliesin, and in the <i>Mabinogion</i>, as being of a clear
shining white, with red ears; colouring which confirms the author
of the <i>Mythology of the Ancient Druids</i> in the idea that
these dogs were "a mystical transformation of the Druids with their
white robes and red tiaras." Popular superstition, however, which
must always attribute ugliness to an object of fear, deems that
they are either jet black, with eyes and teeth of fire, or of a
deep red, and dripping all over with gore. "The nearer," says the
Rev. Edmund Jones, "they are to a man, the <i>less</i> their voice
is, and the farther the louder, sometimes swelling like the voice
of a great hound, or a blood-hound."</p>
<p>They are <i>sometimes</i> accompanied by a female fiend, called
<i>Malt y nos</i>&mdash;Mathilda or Malen of the night, a somewhat
ubiquitous character, with whom we meet under a complication of
names and forms.</p>
<p>Jones of Brecon, who tells us that the cry of the Cron Annwn is
as familiar to the inhabitants of Ystrad Fellte and Pont
Neath-vaughan [in Glamorganshire] as the watchman's rattle in the
purlieus of Covent Garden&mdash;for he lived in the days when
watchmen and their rattles were yet among the things of this
world&mdash;considers that to these dogs, and not to a Greek myth,
may be referred the hounds, <i>Fury</i>, <i>Silver</i>,
<i>Tyrant</i>, &amp;c., with which Prospero hunts his enemies
"soundly," in the <i>Tempest</i>. And they must recall to the minds
of our readers the <i>wisk</i>, <i>wisked</i>, or <i>Yesk</i>
hounds of Devon, which are described in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
for March 27. 1847, as well as the <i>Maisne Hellequin</i> of
Normandy and Bretagne.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion respecting the signification of
the word <i>Annwn</i>, which has been increased by the very
frequent mistake of writing it <i>Anwn</i>, which means,
<i>unknown</i>, <i>strange</i>, and is applied to the people who
dwell in the antipodes of the speaker; while <i>Annwn</i> is an
adaptation of <i>annwfn</i>, a <i>bottomless</i> or <i>immeasurable
pit</i>, <i>voidless</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"
id="page295"></a>{295}</span> <i>space</i>, and also Hell. Thus we
find, that when <i>Pwyl</i>, or <i>Reason</i>, drives these dogs
off their track, the owner comes up, and, reproving him, declares
that he is a crowned king, lord of Annwn and Pendaran, <i>i.e.</i>
chief of thunder. (See <i>Myth. Ant. Druids</i>, p. 418.)</p>
<p>This Prince of Darkness is supposed to be the spouse of
Andraste, now corrupted into Andras, and equivalent with <i>Malt y
nos</i>, the Diana or Hecate of the ancient Britons.</p>
<p>These dogs sometimes appear singly, on which occasions they sit
by the side of a stream, howling in so unearthly a manner, that the
hapless man who finds one in his path usually loses his senses.
This seems to have a connection with the "Manthe Doog" of the Isle
of Man; but the tradition is not, we suspect, genuine.</p>
<p class="author">Seleucus.</p>
<p>No. 2. <i>Cyoeraeth or Gwrach-y-rhybin.</i>&mdash;Another
instance of the grand, though gloomy superstitions of the Cymry, is
that of the <i>Cyoeraeth</i>, or hag of the mist, an awful being
who is supposed to reside in the mountain fog, through which her
supernatural shriek is frequently heard. She is believed to be the
very personification of ugliness, with torn and dishevelled hair,
long black teeth, lank and withered arms and claws, and a most
cadaverous appearance; to this some add, wings of a leathery and
bat-like substance.</p>
<p>The name <i>Cy-oer-aeth</i>, the last two syllables of which
signify <i>cold-grief</i>, is most descriptive of the sad wail
which she utters, and which will, it is said, literally freeze the
veins of those who hear it; she is <i>rarely</i> seen, but is heard
at a cross-road, or beside a stream&mdash;in the latter case she
splashes the water with her hands&mdash;uttering her lamentation,
as if in allusion to the relatives of those about to die. Thus, if
a man hears her cry <i>fy nqwsaig, fy nqwsaig</i>, &amp;c., his
wife will surely die, and he will be heard to mourn in the same
strain ere long; and so on with other cases. The cadence of this
cry can never be properly caught by any one who has not heard, if
not a Cyoeraeth, at least a native of Wales, repeat the strain.
When merely an inarticulate scream is heard, it is probable that
the hearer himself is the one whose death is fore-mourned.</p>
<p>Sometimes she is supposed to come like the Irish <i>banshee</i>,
in a dark mist, to the windows of those who have been long ill;
when flapping her wings against the pane, she repeats their names
with the same prolonged emphasis; and then it is thought that they
must die.</p>
<p>It is this hag who forms the torrent beds which seam the
mountain side; for she gathers great stones in her cloak to make
her ballast, when she flies upon the storm; and when about to
retire to her mountain cave, she lets them drop progressively as
she moves onwards, when they fall with such an unearthly weight
that they lay open the rocky sides of the mountain.</p>
<p>In some parts of South Wales this hag of the mists either loses
her sway, or divides it with a more dignified personage, who, in
the form of an old man, and under the name of <i>Brenhin Llwyd</i>,
the <i>grey king</i>, sits ever silent in the mist.</p>
<p>Any one who has witnessed the gathering and downward rolling of
a genuine mountain fog must fully appreciate the spirit in which
men first peopled the cloud with such supernatural beings a those
above described; or with those which dimly, yet constantly, pervade
the much-admired <i>Legend of Montrose</i>.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM BASSE AND HIS POEMS.</h3>
<p>I regret that I am unable to offer any information in answer to
"Mr. P. Collier's" inquiry (No. 13. p. 200.) respecting the
existence of a perfect or imperfect copy of a poem by William Basse
on the Death of Prince Henry, printed at Oxford by Joseph Barnes,
1613, and am only aware of such a poem from the slight mention of
it by Sir Harris Nicolas in his beautiful edition of Walton's
<i>Complete Angler</i>, p. 422. But as the possessor of the 4to.
MS. volume of poems by Basse, called <i>Polyhymnia</i>, formerly
belonging to Mr. Heber, I feel greatly interested in endeavouring
to obtain some further biographical particulars of Basse,&mdash;of
whom, although personally known to Isaac Walton, the author of one
or two printed volumes of poems, and of the excellent old songs of
"the Hunter in his Career" and "Tom of Bedlam," and worthy of
having his verses on Shakspeare inserted among his collected poems,
yet the notices we at present possess are exceedingly slight. We
learn from Anth. Wood, in his <i>Ath. Oxon.</i>, vol. iv. p. 222.,
that Basse was a native of Moreton, near Thame in Oxfordshire, and
was for some time a retainer of Sir Richard Wenman, Knt.,
afterwards Viscount Wenman, in the peerage of Ireland. He seems
also to have been attached to the noble family of Norreys of Ricot
in Oxfordshire, which is not far from Thame; and addressed some
verses to Francis Lord Norreys, Earl of Berkshire, from which I
quote one or two stanzas, and in the last of which there is an
allusion to the [plainness of the] author's personal
appearance:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"O true nobilitie, and rightly grac'd</p>
<p>With all the jewels that on thee depend,</p>
<p>Where goodnesse doth with greatnesse live embrac'd,</p>

<p>Where ample lands, in ample hands are plac'd</p>
<p>And ancient deeds, with ancient coats descend:</p>
<p class="i2">Where noble bloud combin'd with noble spirit</p>

<p>Of this great House, and those that henceforth shall</p>
<p>(As that will last) for ever sing the same.</p>
<p>But, if on me, my garland instly fall,</p>
<p>I justly owe my musique to this name.</p>
<p class="i2">For he unlawfully usurps the Bayes</p>

<p>His Polyhymnia is dedicated to the sister of this person, the
Lady Bridget, Countess of Lindsey, and Baroness of Eresbie and of
Ricot. Besides the "Anglers' Song" made at Walton's request, and
the before-mentioned two songs, which are given at length in the
Appendix to the <i>Complete Angler</i>, p. 420., Sir H. Nicolas's
edit., besides these, and the verses "on William Shakespeare, who
died in April, 1616," sometimes called "Basse his Elegie on
Shakespeare," which appear in the edition of Shakespeare's Poems of
1640, 8vo., and are reprinted in Malone's edition of his Plays,
vol. i. p. 470.: another poem by William Basse will be found in the
collection entitled <i>Annalia Dubrensia, upon the Yearely
Celebration of Mr. Robert Dover's Olympick Games upon Cotswold
Hills</i>, 4to. 1636. This consists of ten stanzas, of eight lines
each, "To the noble and fayre Assemblies, the harmonious concourse
of Muses, and their Ioviall entertainer, my right generous Friend,
Master Robert Dover, upon Cotswold." Basse was also, as Mr. Collier
remarks, the author of a poem, which I have never seen, called
<i>Sword and Buckler, or Serving Man's Defence</i>, in six-line
stanzas, 4to. Lond., imprinted in 1602. A copy of this was sold in
Steevens's sale, No. 767., and is now among "Malone's Collection of
Early Poetry" in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. And, according to
Ritson, he wrote another work, published in the same year, viz.
<i>Three Pastorall Elegies of Anander, Anytor and Muridella</i>,
entered to Joseph Barnes, 28 May, 1692, of which I am not aware
that any copy is now in existence. These, with the addition of
<i>Great Brittaines Sunnes-set, bewailed with a Shower of
Teares</i>, at Oxford, printed by Joseph Barnes, 1613, the fragment
of which is in the possession of Mr. Collier, appear, as far as I
can yet ascertain, to be the only known publications of William
Basse, with his name attached to them in full. Other works,
however, have been attributed to him from the similarity of the
initials,&mdash;but most of them probably without much foundation;
viz. 1. <i>Scacchia Ludus: Chesse-play</i>: a poetical translation
of Vida's poem at the end of <i>Ludus Sacchi&aelig;,
Chesse-Play</i>, by W.B. 4to. Lond. 1597; by Ritson. 2. <i>A Helpe
to Discourse; or a Miscelany of Merriment</i>, by W.B. and E.P. 2nd
edit. 8vo. Lond. 1620; by Mr. Malone. And 3. <i>That which seemes
Best is Worst, exprest in a Paraphrastical Transcript of Iuuenals
tenth Satyre. Together with the Tragicall Narration of Virginius
Death interserted</i>, by W.B. small 8vo. Lond.; imprinted by Felix
Kyngston, 1617, by Mr. Octavius Gilchrist, who however rather leans
to the opinion of William Barkstead being the author, from the
circumstance of his having, as early as 1607, paraphrased, much in
a similar way, the interesting tale of Myrrha, the mother of
Adonis, from the 10th Book of the Metamorphoses. (See
<i>Restitutu</i>, vol. i. p. 41.)</p>
<p>Cole, in his MS. Collectanea for <i>Athen&aelig;
Cantabrigiensis</i>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Knight, jun. shewed me a MS. written by William Basse, and
corrected by him, in 4to., called
<i>Polyhymnia</i>.&mdash;Dedication. To the Right Noble and
vertuous Lady, the Lady Bridget, Countess of Lindsey, and Baroness
of Eresbie and Ricot, in verse, with Verses to the Right Hon.
Francis Lord Norreys, Earl of Berkshire (in his days). To the Right
Hon. the Lady Aungier (then wife of Sir Thos. Wenman) upon her
coming out of Ireland and return thither. To the Right Hon. the
lady Viscountess Falkland, upon her going into Ireland, two
Sonnets. The Youth in the Boat. Acrostics of the truly noble,
vertuous, and learned Lady, the Lady Agnes Wenman; of the Lady
Penelope Dynham; of Mrs. Jane Wenman. Verses on the Chapel of
Wadham College consecration, St. Peter's Day, 1613; on Caversham or
Causham House; of Witham House, Oxfordshire, the house of a noble
Knight, and favourer of my Muse; and Elegy on a Bullfinch, 1648; of
the Four Mile Course of Bayaides Green, six times run over, by two
famous Irish footmen, Patrick Dorning and William
O'Farrell.&mdash;It contains about 40 leaves, much corrected, and
at the end is 'L'Envoy':&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Go, sweet Polymnia, thanks for all your cost</p>
<p>And love to me; wherein no love is lost.</p>
<p>As you have taught me various verse to use,</p>
<p>I have to right you to be a Christian Muse.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have been thus particular in transcribing this passage from
Cole, because this copy, mentioned as being in the possession of
Mr. Knight, jun. (quere, where is it now?), varies from mine,
obtained from Mr. Heber's Collection, and was no doubt the one
prepared and corrected for the press by Basse. The following poems,
mentioned by Cole, are not in my copy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To the Right Hon. the Lady Aungier (then wife of Sir Thos.
Wenman) upon her coming out of Ireland, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>{297}</span> and
return thither. Acrostics of the truly noble, vertuous, and learned
Lady, the Lady Agnes Wenman; of the Lady Penelope Dynham; of Mrs.
Jane Wenman. Verses on the Chapel of Wadham College consecration,
St. Peter's Day, 1613; and on Caversham or Causham House."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My copy, however, contains the following poems, not mentioned in
the other:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Of a Great Floud; of the Raine-bowe; of Pen and Pensill, upon a
fayre and vertuous Ladye's Picture; and the Spirituall Race."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MS. contains 52 leaves, beautifully written without any
corrections, and is in the original binding. It was procured by Mr.
Heber from Hanwell, the Bookseller in Oxford, who had probably
purchased it on the taking down of Ricot, the old seat of the
Norreys family, and the dispersion of its contents. It has the
autograph of Francis Lord Norreys on the fly-leaf, and was no doubt
a presentation copy to him from Basse. The poetry of this work does
not rise above mediocrity, and is not equal in thought or vigour to
the Epitaph on Shakspeare. The chief portion of the volume is
occupied with the singular tale of "The Youth in the Boat," which
is divided into two parts; the first, containing (with the
introduction) 59 verses of four lines each, and the second 163,
exclusive of the "Morall," which occupies 11 more.</p>
<p>We know that it was Basse's intention to have published these
poems, from some lines addressed by Dr. Ralph Bathurst "To Mr. W.
Basse upon the intended publication of his poems, January 13.
1651," which are given in Warton's <i>Life and Literary Remains of
Dean Bathurst</i>, 8vo. 1761, p. 288. In these lines the Dean
compares Basse, who was still living, "to an aged oak," and
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Though thy grey Muse grew up with elder times,</p>
<p>And our deceased Grandsires lisp'd thy rhymes,</p>
<p>Yet we can sing thee too."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>From these lines, therefore, written nearly 50 years after the
publication of his former works in 1602, when we may reasonably
suppose he could not have been under 20, it is certain that Basse
was then well stricken in years; and the probability is, that he
died very shortly afterwards, and that this was the reason of the
non-publication of his poems. It is possible that a search into the
registers at Thame or that neighbourhood, or in the court at
Oxford, might settle this point, and also furnish some further
information concerning his family and connections. Cole mentions
that a person of both his names was admitted a sizar in Emanuel
College, Cambridge, in 1629, of Suffolk, and took his degree of
B.A. in 1632 and M.A. in 1636. But this was too modern a date for
our poet, and might possibly be his son.</p>
<p>I have been informed that in Winchester College library, in a
4to. volume, there are some poems by Mr. William Basse; but the
title of the volume I have not been able to obtain.</p>
<p>Mr. Collier concludes his remarks, with a supposition that Basse
"was a musical composer, as well as writer of verses." I believe
Mr. C. to be right in this notion, from a passage which I find in
the commencement of the 2nd Part of "The Youth in the Boat," where,
alluding to "sweete Calliope," he remarks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A Muse to whom in former dayes</p>
<p class="i2">I was extremely bound,</p>
<p>When I did sing in <i>Musiques</i> prayse,</p>
<p class="i2">And <i>Voyces</i> heau'nly sound."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And from the circumstance also of one of the Ballads in the
Roxburghe Collection, "Wit's never good till 'tis bought," being
sung to the tune of "Basse's Carreere." Mr. Collier has reprinted
this in his elegant <i>Book of Roxburghe Ballads</i>, 4to. 1847, p.
264., and says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The tune to which is sung, 'Basse's Carreere,' means of course,
the tune mentioned in Walton's <i>Angler</i>, 'The Hunter in his
Career,' composed, as he states by William Basse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a distant recollection of having seen other pieces in
some of our early musical works, composed by Basse. Sir Harris
Nicolas, also, in the "Life of Walton," prefixed to his edition of
<i>The Complete Angler</i>, p. cxx., says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He (Walton) appears to have been fond of poetry and music....
and was intimate with <i>Basse, an eminent composer</i>, in whose
science he took great interest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fear that these notices of William Basse, thus collected
together from scattered sources, will not afford much information
to Mr. Collier, beyond what he is already possessed of; but they
may possibly interest others, who may not be quite so conversant
with our early writers as that gentleman is known to be. I shall
feel much gratified and obliged if he or any other of your
correspondents will add any further notices or communications
respecting one who may possibly have been personally known to
Shakspeare, but whose name, at all events, will be handed down to
posterity in connection with that of our immortal bard.</p>

<h3>JOHN STOWE.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. vii., new series, p.
48., is a clever notice of the life and works of the venerable John
Stowe. It says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The biographers have affirmed that he quitted his trade; but
there is nothing to authorize that assertion in what he says
himself upon the subject."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the preface to an edition of the <i>Summarie for the Year</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id=
"page298"></a>{298}</span> 1575, now in my possession, Stowe
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is nowe x yeres, since I (seeing the confuse order of our
late englishe Chronicles, and the ignorant handling of aunciet
affaires) leaning myne own peculiar gains, coscerated my selfe to
the searche of our famous antiquities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stowe was born in 1525; he was then 40 years of age when he gave
up his "peculiar gains," and devoted himself entirely to
antiquarian labours. There had already appeared his edition of
<i>Chaucer</i> in 1561, also the commencement of the
<i>Summaries</i>; but his greater works, the <i>Annals, Survey of
London</i>, &amp;c., were not published till several years
after.</p>
<p>In his old age he was reduced to poverty, or rather to actual
beggary; for shortly before his death, when fourscore years old, he
was permitted, by royal letters patent, to become a mendicant. This
curious document is printed in Mr. Bolton Corney's <i>Curiosities
of Literature Illustrated</i>, and sets forth, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas our louing Subject, John Stowe, this fine &amp; forty
yeers hath to his great charge, &amp; with neglect of his ordinary
meanes of maintenance (for the generall good as well of posteritie,
as of the present age) compiled and published diuerse necessary
bookes &amp; Chronicles; and therefore we, in recompense of these
his painfull laboures, &amp; for the encouragement to the like,
haue in our royall inclination ben pleased to graunt our Letters
Patents &amp;c. &amp;c.; thereby authorizing him and his deputies
to collect amongst our louing subjects, theyr voluntary
contributions &amp; kinde gratuities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole preface to this edition of the <i>Summarie</i> is
curious, and is followed by a List of "Authors out of whom this
Summary is collected."</p>
<p>In Hearne's <i>Robert of Gloster</i>, preface, p. lxi., allusion
is made to these <i>Summaries</i>. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have not yet met with a copy of this <i>Summary</i> in which
we have an account of his authors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a panegyric on Stowe's incredible industry he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sir Roger Lestrange, talking some years before his death with a
very ingenious and learned Gentleman about our Historians, was
pleased to say, <i>that it was always a wonder to him, that the
very best that had penn'd our History in English should be a poor
Taylour, honest John Stowe</i>. Sir Roger said a <i>Taylour</i>,
because Stowe, as is reported, was bred a cap-maker. The trade of
Cap-making was then much in fashion, Hats being not at that time
much in request."</p>

<h3>TRANSPOSITION OF LETTERS.</h3>
<p>The only reason, I imagine, which can be given for the
transposition of letters spoken of by Mr. Williams (No. 12. p.
184.), is that it was done on "phonetic" principles&mdash;for the
sake of euphony:&mdash;the new way was felt or fancied to be easier
to the organs of speech, or (which is nearly the same) pleasanter
to those of hearing. Such alterations have at all times been
made,&mdash;as is well known to those versed in the earlier stages
of the language,&mdash;and often most arbitrarily. It is needless
to say that "provincial and vulgar" usage throws much light on the
changes in the forms of words; and perhaps a little attention to
the manner in which words are altered by the peasantry would
illustrate the point in question more than a learned comment.</p>
<p>No form of verbal corruption is more frequent throughout the
rural districts of England than that produced by the transposition
of letters, especially of consonants: such words as <i>world</i>,
<i>wasp</i>, <i>great</i>, are, as every one knows, still
ordinarily (though less frequently than a dozen years ago)
pronounced <i>wordle</i>, <i>waps</i>, <i>gurt</i>. So with names
of places: thus Cholsey (Berks.) is called Chosley.</p>
<p>The dropping of a letter is to be accounted for in a like
manner. Probably the word was first <i>pronounced</i> short, and
when the ear became accustomed to the shortened sound, the
superfluous (or rather unpronounced) letter would be dropped in
writing. In proper names, to which your correspondent particularly
refers, we observe this going on extensively in the present day.
Thus, in Caermarthen and Caernarvon, though the <i>e</i> is
etymologically of importance, it is now very generally
omitted&mdash;and that by "those in authority:" in the Ordnance
Maps, Parliamentary "Blue Books," and Poor-law documents, those
towns are always spelled Carnarvon, Carmarthen. A still more
striking instance is that of a well-known village on the Thames,
opposite Runnimede. Awhile back it was commonly spelled
Wyrardisbury; now it appears on the time-tables of the
South-Western Railway (and perhaps elsewhere) Wraysbury, which very
nearly represents the local pronunciation.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, worth while to remark that letters are sometimes
added as well as dropped by the peasantry. Thus the Cockley, a
little tributary of Wordsworth's <i>Duddon</i>, is by the natives
of Donnerdale invariably called Cocklety beck; whether for the sake
of euphony, your readers may decide.</p>
<p>And now, Sir, you will perhaps permit me to put a query. Tom
Brown, in his <i>Dialogues</i>, p. 44. ed. 1704., has a well-known
line:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Why was not he a rascal</p>
<p>Who refused to suffer the Children of Israel to go</p>
<p>into the Wilderness with their wives and families</p>
<p>to eat the Paschal?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which he says he found on some "very ancient hangings in a
country ale-house." I have never doubted that he was himself the
author; but having heard it positively ascribed to a very different
person, I should be glad to know whether <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>{299}</span> any of
your readers have met with it in an earlier writer; and if so, to
whom is it to be ascribed?</p>
<p class="author">J.T.</p>
<p><i>Pet-Names&mdash;"Jack."</i>&mdash;Perhaps one of your many
readers, erudite in etymologies, will kindly explain how "Jack"
came to be used as the <i>diminutive</i> for John. Dr. Kennedy, in
his recent interesting disquisition on pet-names (No. 16. p. 242.),
supposes that Jaques was (by confusion) transmuted into "Jack;" a
"metamorphosis," almost as violent as the celebrated one effected,
some two centuries ago, by Sir John Harrington. "Poor John," from
being so long "Jack among his familiars," has been most scurvily
treated, being employed to form sundry very derogatory compounds,
such as, Jackass, Jackpudding, Jack-a-dandy, Jackanapes,
Jack-a-lent, Jack o' oaks (knave of clubs), Jack-o' th' Lantern,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Might not "Jack" have been derived from John,
somewhat after the following
fashion:&mdash;Johan&mdash;Joan&mdash;Jan&mdash;Janchen or
Jankin.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ho! jolly Jenkin,</p>
<p>I spy a knave in drinkin."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Jankin = little John. Jank&mdash;Jak. This etymology has, I
confess, a very great resemblance to the Millerian mode of educing
Cucumber from Jeremiah King; but it is the most plausible which
occurs at present to</p>
<p class="author">L. Kennaquhair.</p>
<p><i>John&mdash;Pisan.</i>&mdash;I will thank you to inform your
correspondent "C." (No. 15 p. 234.), that we must look to the East
for the "original word" of John. In the Waldensian MSS. of the
Gospels of the 12th Century, we find Ioanes, showing its derivation
from the Greek <i>Iohannaes</i>. The word Pisan occurs in the 33rd
vol. of the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, p. 131.</p>
<p>I have considered it was a contraction for <i>pavoisine</i>, a
small shield; and I believe this was the late Dr. Meyrick's
opinion.</p>
<p class="author">B.W. Feb. 25.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;If the signature to the article in No. 16., "on Pet
Names," had not been Scottish, I should have been less surprised at
the author's passing over the name of <i>Jock</i>, universally used
in Scotland for <i>John</i>. The termination <i>ick</i> or
<i>ck</i> is often employed, as marking a diminutive object, or
object of endearment. May not the English term <i>Jack</i>, if not
directly borrowed from the Scottish <i>Jock</i>, have been formed
<i>through</i> the primary
<i>Jock</i>&mdash;John&mdash;Jock&mdash;Jack?</p>
<p class="author">EMDEE.</p>
<p><i>Origin of the Change of "Mary" into "Polly"</i> (No. 14. p.
215.).&mdash;This change, like many others in diminutives, is
progressive. By a natural affinity between the liquids <i>r</i> and
<i>l</i>, <i>Mary</i> becomes <i>Molly</i>, as <i>Sarah</i>,
<i>Sally</i>, <i>Dorothea</i>, <i>Dora</i>, <i>Dolly</i>, &amp;c.
It is not so easy to trace the affinity between the <i>initials</i>
M. and P., though the case is not singular; thus, <i>Margaret</i>,
Madge, Meggy, Meg, <i>Peggy</i>, <i>Peg</i>&mdash;<i>Martha</i>,
Matty, <i>Patty</i>&mdash;and <i>Mary</i>, Molly, <i>Polly</i> and
<i>Poll</i>; in which last abbreviation not one single letter of
the original word remains: the natural affinity between the two
letters, as <i>medials</i>, is evident, as in the following
examples, all of which, with one exception, are Latin derivatives:
<i>empty</i>, <i>peremptory</i>, <i>sumptuous</i>,
<i>presumptuous</i>, <i>exemption</i>, <i>redemption</i>, and
<i>sempstress</i> and again, in the words <i>tempt</i>,
<i>attempt</i>, <i>contempt</i>, <i>exempt</i>, <i>prompt</i>,
<i>accompt</i>, <i>comptroller</i> (vid. Walker's <i>Prin. of Eng.
Pron.</i> pp. 42, 43.); in all which instances however, the
<i>p</i> is mute, so that "Mary" is avenged for its being the
accomplice in the desecration of her gentle name into "Polly." Many
names of the other sex lose their initials in the diminutive;
as,</p>

<h3>PARALLEL PASSAGES OR PLAGIARISMS IN CHILDE HAROLD.</h3>
<p>Permit me to add two further plagiarisms or parallel passages on
the subject of <i>Childe Harold</i> to those already contributed by
your valuable correspondent "Melanion."</p>
<p>Mrs. Radcliffe (who I am informed was never out of England) is
describing in her <i>Mysteries of Udolpho</i>, Chap. xvi. the
appearance of Venice. "Its terraces, crowded with airy, yet
majestic fabrics touched as they now were with the splendour of the
setting sun, appeared as if they had been <i>called up from the
Ocean by the wand of an enchanter</i>."</p>
<p>In the 1st stanza of the 4th canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> we
have the well known lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I stood in Venice on the bridge of sighs,</p>
<p>A palace and a prison on each hand:</p>
<p>I saw from out the wave her structures rise</p>
<p>As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In one of his letters Lord Byron tells us of his fondness for
the above novel.</p>
<p>Again in Kirke White's <i>Christiad</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"The lyre which I in early days have strung,</p>

<h3>INEDITED LINES BY ROBERT BURNS.</h3>
<p>The following lines by Robert Burns have never appeared in any
collection of his works. They were given to me some time ago at
Chatham Barracks by Lieut. Colonel Fergusson, R.M., formerly of
Dumfriesshire, by whom they were copied from the <i>tumbler</i>
upon which they were originally written.</p>
<p>Shortly before the death of Alan Cunningham I sent these verses
to him, as well as two Epigrams of Burns, "On Howlet Face," and "On
the Mayor of Carlisle's impounding his Horse," which were not
included in his edition of Burns' works. In a letter which I
received from Alan Cunningham, and which now lies before me, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The pieces you were so good as to send me are by Burns, and the
Epigrams are old acquaintances of mine. I know not how I came to
omit them. I shall print them in the next edition, and say it was
you who reminded me of them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that one or both of the Epigrams were printed in the
8vo. edition of the works in one volume, but my name is not
mentioned as the contributor, which I regret; for, as an
enthusiastic admirer of Burns, and a collector for many years of
his fugitive pieces, it would have been gratifying to me to have
been thus noticed. Perhaps Cunningham did not superintend that
edition.</p>
<p>The verses I now send you, and which may, perhaps, be worth
preserving in your valuable miscellany, originated thus:&mdash;On
occasion of a social meeting at Brownhill inn, in the parish of
Closeburn, near Dumfries, which was, according to Alan Cunningham,
"a favourite resting-place of Burns," the poet, who was one of the
party, was not a little delighted by the unexpected appearance of
his friend William Stewart. He seized a tumbler, and in the fulness
of his heart, wrote the following lines on it with a diamond. The
tumbler is carefully preserved, and was shown some years since by a
relative of Mr. Stewart, at his cottage at Closeburn, to Colonel
Fergusson, who transcribed the lines, and gave them to me with the
assurance that they had never been printed.</p>
<p>The first verse is an adaptation of a well known Jacobite
lyric.</p>
<div class="poem">

<h3>LACED&AElig;MONIAN BLACK BROTH.</h3>
<p>Your correspondent "R.O." having inquired after the author of
the conjecture that the Laced&aelig;monian Black Broth was composed
wholly, or in part, of coffee, such an idea appearing to me to have
arisen principally from a presumed identity of colour between the
two, and to have no foundation in fact, I have endeavoured to
combat it, in the first instance by raising the question, whether
it was black or not?</p>
<p>This has brought us to the main point, what the [Greek: zomos
melas] really was. And here "R.O." appears to rest content upon the
probablity of coffee having been an ingredient. Permit me to assign
some additional reasons for entertaining a different opinion.</p>
<p>We read nothing in native writers of anything like coffee in
Greece, indigenous or imported; and how in the world was it to get
into Laconia, inhabited, as it is well known to have been, by a
race of men the least prone of any to change their customs, and the
least accessible to strangers. Lycurgus, we are told, forbade his
people to be sailors, or to contend at sea<a id="footnotetag6"
name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, so
that they had no means of importing it themselves; and what foreign
merchant would sell it to them, who had only iron money to pay
withal, and dealt, moreover, as much as possible by way of
barter?<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>But it may be said they cultivated the plant themselves; that
is, in other words, that the Helots raised it for them. If so, how
happens it that all mention of the berry is omitted in the
catalogue of their monthly contributions to the Phiditia, which are
said to have consisted of meal, wine, cheese, figs, and a very
little money?<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href=
"#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> and when the king of Pontus<a id=
"footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href=
"#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> indulged in the expensive fancy of
buying to himself (not hiring, let it be recollected) a cook, to
make that famous broth which Dionysius found so detestable, how
came he not at the same time to think of buying a pound of coffee
also? Moreover, if we consider its universal popularity at present,
it is hardly to be supposed that, in ancient times, coffee would
have suited no palate except that of a Laced&aelig;monian.</p>
<p>With respect to the colour of the broth, I am reminded of my own
reference to <i>Pollux</i>, lib. vi. who is represented by your
correspondent to say that the [Greek: melas zomos] was also called
[Greek: aimatia], a word which Messrs. Scott and Liddell interpret
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id=
"page301"></a>{301}</span> denote "blood broth," and go on to
state, upon the authority of Manso, that blood was a principal
ingredient in this celebrated Laced&aelig;monian dish. Certainly,
if the case were really so, the German writer would have succeeded
in preparing for us a most disagreeable and warlike kind of food;
but my astonishment has not been small, upon turning to the
passage, to find that "R.O.'s" authorities had misled him, and that
<i>Pollux</i> really says nothing of the kind. His words (I quote
from the edition 2 vols. folio, Amst. 1706) are these,</p>
<p>[Greek: "O de melas kaloumenos zomos Lakonikon men hos epi to
poly to edesma. esti de hae kaloumenae haimatia. to de thrion hode
eskeuazon, k.t.l."]</p>
<p>The general subject of the section is the different kinds of
flesh used by man for food, and incidentally the good things which
may be made from these; which leads the writer to mention by name
many kinds of broth, amongst which he says towards the end, is that
called [Greek: melas zomos] which might be considered almost as a
Laced&aelig;monian dish; adding further, that there was a something
called h&aelig;matia (and this might have been a black pudding or
sausage for anything that appears to the contrary); also the
thrium, which was prepared in a manner he proceeds to describe. Now
the three parts of the sentence which has been given above in the
original do, to the best of my judgment, clearly refer to three
different species of food; and I would appeal to the candid opinion
of any competent Greek scholar, whether, according to the idiom of
that language, the second part of it is so expressed, as to connect
it with, and make it explanatory of, the first. We want, for this
purpose, a relative, either with or without [Greek: esti]; and the
change of gender in h&aelig;matia seems perfectly unaccountable if
it is intended to have any reference to [Greek: zomos].</p>
<p>It may not be unimportant to add that the significant silence of
Meursius, (an author surely not to be lightly thought of) who in
his <i>Miscellanea Laconica</i> says nothing of blood broth at the
Phiditia, implies that he understood the passage of Pollux as
intended to convey the meaning expressed above.</p>
<p>Another lexicographer, Hesychius, informs us that [Greek: Bapha]
was the Laced&aelig;monian term for [Greek: zomos]; and this,
perhaps, was the genuine appellation for that which other Greeks
expressed by a periphrasis, either in contempt or dislike, or
because its colour was really dark, the juices of the meat being
thoroughly extracted into it. That it was nutritive and powerful
may be inferred from what Plutarch mentions, that the older men
were content to give up the meat to the younger ones, and live upon
the broth only<a id="footnotetag10" name=
"footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>, which,
had it been very poor, they would not have done.</p>
<p>When these remarks were commenced, it was for the purpose of
showing, by means of a passage not generally referred to, what the
ancients conceived the "black broth" to be, and that consequently,
all idea of coffee entering into its composition was untenable. How
far this has been accomplished the reader must decide: but I cannot
quit the subject without expressing my sincere persuasion, founded
upon a view of the authorities referred to, that the account given
by Athen&aelig;us is substantially correct. Pig meat would be much
in use with a people not disposed to take the trouble of preparing
any other: the animal was fit for nothing but food; and the refuse
of their little farms would be sufficient for his keep.
Athen&aelig;us also, in another passage, supplies us with a
confirmation of the notion that <i>the stock</i> was made from
<i>pig</i>, and this is stronger because it occurs incidentally. It
is found in a quotation from Matron, the maker of parodies, who,
alluding to some person or other who had not got on very well at a
Laced&aelig;monian feast, explains the cause of his failure to have
been, that the black broth, and boiled odds and ends of pig meat,
had beaten him;</p>
<p>"[Greek: Damna min zomos te melas akrokolia t' hephtha.]"<a id=
"footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href=
"#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>That their cookery was not of a very recondite nature, is
evident from what is mentioned by Plutarch, that the public meals
were instituted at first in order to prevent their being in the
hands of artistes and cooks<a id="footnotetag12" name=
"footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, while
to these every one sent a stated portion of provisions, so that
there would neither be change nor variety in them. Cooks again were
sent out of Sparta, if they could do more than dress meat<a id=
"footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href=
"#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>; while the only seasoning allowed
to them was salt and vinegar<a id="footnotetag14" name=
"footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>; for
which reason, perhaps, Meursius considers the composition of the
[Greek: zomos melas] to have been pork gravy seasoned with vinegar
and salt<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href=
"#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>, since there seemed to have been
nothing else of which it could possibly have been made.</p>
<p>For MR. TREVELYAN's suggestion of the cuttlefish, I am greatly
obliged to him; but this was an Athenian dish, and too good for the
severity of Spartan manners. It is impossible not to smile at the
idea of the distress which Cineparius must have felt, had he
happened to witness the performances of any persons thus swallowing
ink bottles by wholesale.</p>
<p>The passages which have been already quoted, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>{302}</span> either by
R.O. or myself, will probably give Mr. T. sufficient information of
the principal ones in which the "black broth" is mentioned.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>TEN QUERIES CONCERNING POETS AND POETRY.</h3>
<p>1. In a curious poetical tract, entitled <i>A Whip for an Ape,
or Martin displaied</i>; no date, but printed in the reign of
Elizabeth, occurs the following stanza:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And ye grave men that answere Martin's mowes,</p>
<p>He mockes the more, and you in vain loose times.</p>
<p>Leave Apes to Dogges to baite, their skins to Crowes,</p>
<p>And let old LANAM lashe him with his rimes."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Was this <i>old Lanam</i>, the same person as Robert Laneham,
who wrote "a Narrative of Queen Elizabeth's Visit to Kenilworth
Castle in 1575"? I do not find his name in Ritson's
<i>Bibliographica Poetica</i>.</p>
<p>2. In Spence's <i>Anecdotes of Books and Men</i> (Singer's edit.
p. 22.), a poet named Bagnall is mentioned as the author of the
once famous poem <i>The Counter Scuffle</i>. Edmund Gayton, the
author of <i>Pleasant Notes upon Don Quixote</i>, wrote a tract, in
verse, entitled <i>Will Bagnall's Ghost</i>. Who was Will Bagnall?
He appears to have been a well-known person, and one of the wits of
the days of Charles the First, but I cannot learn anything of his
biography.</p>
<p>3. In the <i>Common-place Book</i> of Justinian Paget, a lawyer
of James the First's time preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the
British Museum, is the following sonnet:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"My love and I for kisses play'd;</p>
<p class="i2">Shee would keepe stakes, I was content;</p>
<p>But when I wonn she would be pay'd,</p>
<p class="i2">This made me aske her what she ment;</p>
<p>Nay, since I see (quoth she), you wrangle in vaine,</p>
<p class="i2">Take your owne kisses, give me mine againe."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The initials at the end, "W.S.", probably stand for William
Stroud or Strode, whose name is given at length to some other
rhymes in the same MS. I should be glad to know if this quaint
little conceit has been printed before, and if so, in what
collection.</p>
<p>4. What is the earliest printed copy of the beautiful old song
"My Mind to me a Kingdom is?" It is to be found in a rare tract by
Nicholas Breton, entitled <i>The Court and Country, or A Briefe
Discourse betweene the Courtier and Country-man</i>, 4to. 1618.
Query, is Breton its author?</p>
<p>5. Mr. Edward Farr, in his <i>Select Poetry, chiefly Devotional,
of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth</i> (vol. i, p. xix.), calls
Nicholas Breton, <i>Sir Nicholas</i>. Is there any authority for
Breton's knighthood?</p>
<p>6. Can John Davies, the author of <i>Sir Martin Mar-people</i>,
1590, be identified with John Davies of Hereford, or Sir John
Davies, the author of <i>Nosce Teipsum</i>, 1599?</p>
<p>7. In whose possession is the copy of Marlow and Chapman's
<i>Hero and Leander</i>, 1629, sold in Heber's sale (Part iv., No.
1415)? Has the Rev. Alex. Dyce made use of the MS. notes, and the
Latin Epitaph on Sir Roger Manwood, by Marlow, contained in this
copy?</p>
<p>8. Has any recent evidence been discovered as to the authorship
of <i>The Complaynt of Scotland</i>? Is Sir David Lindsay, or
Wedderburn, the author of this very interesting work?</p>
<p>9. In the Rev. J.E. Tyler's <i>Henry of Monmouth</i> (vol. ii
Appendix, p. 417.), is a ballad on <i>The Battle of Agincourt</i>,
beginning as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Fair stood the wind for France,</p>
<p>When we our sails advance;</p>
<p>Nor now to prove our chance,</p>
<p class="i4">Longer will tarry;</p>
<p>But, putting to the main,</p>
<p>At Kaux, the mouth of Seine,</p>
<p>With all his martial train,</p>
<p class="i4">Landed King Harry."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The author of this old ballad, the learned editor says, was
<i>Michael Drayton</i>; but I have not been able to find it in any
edition of his works which I have consulted. Can Mr. Tyler have
confounded it with Drayton's <i>Poem</i> on the same subject? Any
information on this point will be very acceptable.</p>
<p>10. On the fly-leaf of an Old Music Book which I lately
purchased is the following little poem. I do not remember to have
seen it in print, but some of your correspondents may correct
me.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"TO THE LORD BACON WHEN FALLING FROM FAVOUR.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Dazel'd thus with height of place,</p>
<p class="i2">Whilst our hopes our wits beguile;</p>
<p>No man marks the narrow space</p>
<p class="i2">'Twixt a prison and a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Then since fortune's favours fade,</p>
<p class="i2">You that in her arms do sleep,</p>
<p>Learn to swim and not to wade,</p>
<p class="i2">For the hearts of kings are deep.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But if greatness be so blind,</p>
<p class="i2">As to burst in towers of air;</p>
<p>Let it be with goodness lin'd,</p>
<p class="i2">That at least the fall be fair.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Then, though dark'ned you shall say,</p>
<p class="i2">When friends fail and princes frown;</p>
<p>Virtue is the roughest way,</p>
<p class="i2">But proves at night a bed of down."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is in the hand-writing of "Johs. Rasbrick vic. de Kirkton,"
but whether he was the author, or only the transcriber, is
uncertain.</p>

<h3>BISHOP COSIN'S FORM OF CONSECRATION OF CHURCHES.</h3>
<p>We learn from Wilkins (<i>Concilia</i>, tom. iv. p. 566, ed.
Lond. 1737), also from Cardwell (<i>Synodal</i>. pp. 668. 677. 820.
ed. Oxon. 1842), and from some other writers, that the care of
drawing up a Form of Consecration of Churches, Chapels, and
Burial-places, was committed to Bishop Cosin by the Convocation of
1661; which form, when complete, is stated to have been put into
the hands of Robert, Bishop of Oxon, Humphrey, Bishop of Sarum,
Robert, Bishop of Lincoln, and John, Bishop of Coventry and
Lichfield, for revision.</p>
<p>I should feel much obliged if (when you can find space) you
would kindly put the query to your correspondents&mdash;"What has
become of this Form?"</p>
<p>There is at Durham a Form of Consecration of Churches, said to
be in the hand-writing of Basire; at the end of which the following
notes are written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This forme was used at the consecration of Christ's Church,
neare Tinmouth, by the Right Rev. Father in God, John, Lord Bishop
of Duresme, on Sunday, the 5th of July, 1668.</p>
<p>"H&aelig;c forma Consecrationis consonant cum form&acirc;
Reverendi in Christo Patris Lanceloti Andewes, edit. anno 1659.</p>
<p>"Deest Anathema, Signaculum in antiquis dedicationibus.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Deest mentio (Nuptiarum.</p>
<p class="i8">(Purificationis Mulierum."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As this, however, can hardly be the missing Form of Consecration
of Churches, &amp;c., which Cosin himself seems to have drawn up
for the Convocation of 1661, but which appears to have been no more
heard of from the time when it was referred to the four bishops for
revision, the question still remains to be answered&mdash;What has
become of that Form? Can the MS. by any chance have found its way
into the Library of Peterhouse, Cambridge, or into the Chapter
Library at Peterborough&mdash;or is any other unpublished MS. of
Bishop Cosin's known to exist in either of these, or in any other
library?</p>

<h3>PORTRAITS OF LUTHER, ERASMUS, AND ULRIC VON HUTTEN.</h3>
<p>I am very much indebted to "S.W.S." for the information which he
has supplied (No. 15. p. 232.) relative to ancient wood-cut
representations of Luther and Erasmus. As he has mentioned Ulric
von Hutten also (for whom I have an especial veneration, on account
of his having published Valla's famous <i>Declamatio</i> so early
as 1517), perhaps he would have the kindness to state which is
supposed to be the best wood-cut likeness of this resolute ("Jacta
est alea") man. "S.W.S." speaks of a portrait of him which belongs
to the year 1523. I have before me another, which forms the
title-page of the <i>Huttenica</i>, issued "ex Ebernburgo," in
1521. This was, I believe, his place of refuge from the
consequences which resulted from his annexation of marginal notes
to Pope Leo's Bull of the preceding year. In the remarkable
wood-cut with which "[Greek: OYTIS, NEMO]" commences, the object of
which is not immediately apparent, it would seem that "VL." implied
a play upon the initial letters of <i>U</i>lysses and
<i>U</i>lricus. This syllable is put over the head of a person
whose neck looks as if it were already the worse from unfortunate
proximity to the terrible rock wielded by Polyphemus. I should be
glad that "S.W.S." could see some manuscript verses in German,
whcih are at the end of my copy of De Hutten's <i>Conquestio ad
Germanos</i>. They appear to have been written by the author in
1520; and at the conclusion, he has added, "Vale ingrata
patria."</p>

</div>
<p><i>Trophee.</i>&mdash;Who or what was "Trophee?" "Saith Trophee"
occurs in the <i>Monkes Tale</i>. I believe some MSS. read "for
Trophee;" but "saith Trophee" would appear to be the correct
rendering; for Lydgate, in the Prologue to his Translation of
Boccaccio's <i>Fall of Princes</i>, when enumerating the writings
of his "maister Chaucer," tells us, that</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Gave it the name of Troylous and Cressyde."</p>
</div>

proverb is frequently repeated in Devonshire, to denote the
variability of the weather on Friday:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Fridays in the week</p>

<p>Is this bit of weather-wisdom current in other parts of the

have embodied the proverb in some well-known lines,

<h3>LETTER ATTRIBUTED TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.</h3>
<p>In Banks's <i>Dormant Peerage</i>, vol. iii. p. 61., under the
account of <i>Pulteney, Earl of Bath</i>, is the following
extraordinary letter, said to be from Sir Robert Walpole to King
George II., which is introduced as serving to show the discernment
of Walpole, as well as the disposition of the persons by whom he
was opposed, but evidently to expose the vanity and weakness of Mr.
Pulteney, by exhibiting the scheme which was to entrap him into the
acceptance of a peerage, and so destroy his popularity. It is dated
Jan. 24. 1741, but from <i>no place</i>, and has but little
appearance of authenticity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most sacred,</p>
<p>"The violence of the fit of the stone, which has tormented me
for some days, is now so far abated, that, although it will not
permit me to have the honour to wait on your majesty, yet is kind
enough to enable me so far to obey your orders, as to write my
sentiments concerning that troublesome man, Mr. Pulteney; and to
point out (what I conceive to be) the most effectual method to make
him perfectly quiet. Your majesty well knows how by the dint of his
eloquence he has so captivated the mob, and attained an unbounded
popularity, that the most manifest wrong appears to be right, when
adopted and urged by him. Hence it is, that he has become not only
troublesome but dangerous. The inconsiderate multitude think that
he has not one object but public good in view; although, if they
would reflect a little, they would soon perceive that spleen
against those your majesty has honoured with your confidence has
greater weight with him than patriotism. Since, let any measure be
proposed, however salutary, if he thinks it comes from me, it is
sufficient for him to oppose it. Thus, sir, you see the affairs of
the most momentous concern are subject to the caprice of that
popular man; and he has nothing to do but call it a ministerial
project, and bellow out the word <i>favourite</i>, to have an
hundred pens drawn against it, and a thousand mouths open to
contradict it. Under these circumstances, he bears up against the
ministry (and, let me add, against your majesty itself); and every
useful scheme must be either abandoned, or if it is carried in
either house, the public are made to believe it is done by a
corrupted majority. Since these things are thus circumstanced, it
is become necessary for the public tranquility that he should be
made quiet; and the only method to do that effectually is to
destroy his popularity, and ruin the good belief the people have in
him.</p>
<p>"In order to do this, he must be invited to court; your majesty
must condescend to speak to him in the most favourable and
distinguished manner; you must make him believe that he is the only
person upon whose opinion you can rely, and to whom your people
look up for useful measures. As he has already several times
refused to take the lead in the administration, unless it was
totally modelled to his fancy, your majesty should close in with
his advice, and give him leave to arrange the administration as he
pleases, and put whom he chooses into office (there can be no
danger in that as you can dismiss him when you think fit); and when
he has got thus far (to which his extreme self-love and the high
opinion he entertains of his own importance, will easily conduce),
it will be necessary that your majesty should seem to have a great
regard for his health; signifying to him that your affairs will be
ruined if he should die; that you want to have him constantly near
you, to have his sage advice; and that therefore, as he is much
disordered in body, and something infirm, it will be necessary for
his preservation for him to quit the House of Commons, where
malevolent tempers will be continually fretting him, and where,
indeed, his presence will be needless, as no step will be taken but
according to his advice; and that he will let you give him a
distinguishing mark of your approbation, by creating him a peer.
This he may be brought to, for, if I know anything of mankind, he
has a love of honour and money; and, notwithstanding his great
haughtiness and seeming contempt for honour, he may be won if it be
done with dexterity. For, as the poet Fenton says, 'Flattery is an
oil that softens the thoughtless fool.'</p>
<p>"If your majesty can once bring him to accept of a coronet, all
will be over with him; the changing multitude will cease to have
any confidence in him; and when you see that, your majesty may turn
your back to him, dismiss him from his post, turn out his meddling
partizans, and restore things to quiet; the bee will have lost his
sting, and become an idle drone whose buzzing nobody heeds.</p>
<p>"Your majesty will pardon me for the freedom with which I have
given my sentiments and advice; which I should not have done, had
not your majesty commanded it, and had I not been certain that your
peace is much disturbed by the contrivance of that turbulent man. I
shall only add that I will dispose several whom I know to wish him
well to solicit for his establishment in power, that you may seem
to yield to their entreaties, and the finesse be less liable to be
discovered.</p>
<p>"I hope to have the honour to attend your majesty <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span> in a few
days; which I will do privately, that my public presence may give
him no umbrage.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>COLLEGE SALTING.</h3>
<p>In reply to the query of the Rev. Dr. Maitland (No. 17. p.
261.), I would remark, that <i>Salting</i> was the ceremony of
initiating a freshman into the company of senior students or
sophisters. This appears very clearly from a passage in the <i>Life
of Anthony a Wood</i> (ed. 1771, pp. 45-50.). Anthony a Wood was
matriculated in the University of Oxford, 26th May, 1647, and on
the 18th of October "he was entered into the Buttery-Book of Merton
College." At various periods, from All Saints till Candlemas,
"there were Fires of Charcole made in the Common hall."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At all these Fires every Night, which began to be made a little
after five of the clock, the Senior Under-Graduats would bring into
the hall the Juniors or Freshmen between that time and six of the
clock, and there make them sit down on a Forme in the middle of the
Hall, joyning to the Declaiming Desk: which done, every one in
Order was to speake some pretty Apothegme, or make a Jest or Bull,
or speake some eloquent Nonsense, to make the Company laugh: But if
any of the Freshmen came off dull or not cleverly, some of the
forward or pragmatical Seniors would <i>Tuck</i> them, that is, set
the nail of their Thumb to their chin, just under the Lipp, and by
the help of their other Fingers under the Chin, they would give him
a chuck, which sometimes would produce Blood. On Candlemas day, or
before (according as Shrove Tuesday fell out), every Freshman had
warning given him to provide his Speech, to be spoken in the
publick Hall before the Under-Graduats and Servants on
Shrove-Tuesday night that followed, being alwaies the time for the
observation of that Ceremony. According to the said Summons A. Wood
provided a Speech as the other Freshmen did.</p>
<p>"Shrove Tuesday Feb. 15, the Fire being made in the Common hall
before 5 of the Clock at night, the Fellowes would go to Supper
before six, and making an end sooner than at other times, they left
the Hall to the Libertie of the Undergraduats, but with an
Admonition from one of the Fellowes (who was the Principall of the
Undergraduats and Postmasters) that all things should be carried in
good Order. While they were at Supper in the Hall, the Cook (Will.
Noble) was making the lesser of the brass pots full of Cawdle at
the Freshmens Charge; which, after the Hall was free from the
Fellows, was brought up and set before the Fire in the said Hall.
Afterwards every Freshman, according to seniority, was to pluck off
his Gowne and Band, and if possible to make himself look like a
Scoundrell. This done, they were conducted each after the other to
the high Table, and there made to stand on a Forme placed thereon;
from whence they were to speak their Speech with an audible voice
to the Company: which, if well done, the person that spoke it was
to have a Cup of Cawdle and no <i>salted Drinke</i>; if
indifferently, some Cawdle and some <i>salted Drinke</i>; but if
dull, nothing was given to him but <i>salted Drinke</i> or
<i>salt</i> put in College Bere, with Tucks to book. Afterwards
when they were to be admitted into the Fraternity, the Senior Cook
was to administer to them an Oath over an old Shoe, part of which
runs thus: <i>Item tu jurabis, quot penniless bench non visitabis,
&amp;c.</i>: the rest is forgotten, and none there are that now
remembers it. After which spoken with gravity, the Freshman kist
the Shoe, put on his Gowne and Band, and took his place among the
Seniors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wood gives part of his speech, which is ridiculous enough.
It appears that it was so satisfactory that he had cawdle and sack
without and salted drink. He concludes thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This was the way and custome that had been used in the College,
time out of mind, to initiate the Freshmen; but between that time
and the restoration of K. Ch. 2. it was disused, and now such a
thing is absolutely forgotten."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editors in a note intimate that it was probable the custom
was not peculiar to Merton College, and that it was perhaps once
general, as striking traces of it might be found in many societies
in Oxford, and in some a very near resemblance of it had been kept
up until within a few years of that time (1772).</p>
<p class="author">C.H. COOPER.</p>
<p>Cambridge, Feb. 23. 1850.</p>
<p>"E.V.," after quoting the passage given by Mr. Cooper from
Anthony Wood, proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is clear from Owen's epigram that there was some kind of
<i>salting</i> at Oxford as well as at Cambridge; is it not at
least probable that they were both identical with the custom
described by old Anthony, and that the charge made in the college
book was for <i>the cawdle</i> mentioned above, as provided at the
freshman's expense; the whole ceremony going under the name of
"salting," from the salt and water potion, which was the most
important constituent of it? If this be so, it agrees with Dr.
Maitland's idea, that "this 'salting' was some entertainment given
by the newcomer, from and after which he ceases to be fresh;" or,
as Wood expresses it, "he took his place among the seniors."</p>
<p>The "tucks" he speaks of could have been no very agreeable
addition to the salted beer; for, as he himself explains it, a few
lines above, "to tuck" consisted in "setting the nail of the thumb
to their chin, just under the lip, and by the help of their other
fingers under the chin, they would give him a mark, which sometimes
would produce blood."</p>
<p>Before I leave Anthony Wood, let me mention <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>{307}</span> that I
find him making use of the word "bull" in the sense of a laughable
speech ("to make a jest, or <i>bull</i>, or speake some eloquent
nonsense," p. 34.), and of the now vulgar expression "to go to
pot." When recounting the particulars of the parliamentary
visitation of the University in 1648, he tells us, that had it not
been for the intercession of his mother to Sir Nathan Brent, "he
had infallible <i>gone to the pot</i>." If Dr. Maitland or any of
your readers can give the history of these expressions, and can
produce earlier instances of their use, they would greatly oblige
me.</p>
<p>P.S. I ought to mention, that "Penniless Bench" was a seat for
loungers, under a wooden canopy, at the east end of old Carfax
Church: it seems to have been notorious as "the idle corner" of
Oxford.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 5.</h3>
<p>A comparative statement of the number of those who ask
questions, and those who furnish replies, would be a novel
contribution to the statistics of literature. I do note mean to
undertake it, but shall so far assume an excess on the side of the
former class, as to attempt a triad of replies to recent queries
without fear of the censures which attach to monopoly.</p>
<p>To facilitate reference to the queries, I take them in the order
of publication:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. "What is the earliest known instance of the use of a
<i>beaver hat</i> in England?"&mdash;T. Hudson Turner, p. 100.</p>
<p>The following instance from Chaucer (<i>Canterbury tales</i>,
1775, 8&deg;. v. 272.), if not the earliest, is precise and
instructive:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A marchant was ther with a forked berd,</p>
<p>In mottelee, and highe on hors he sat,</p>
<p>And on his hed a Flaundrish <i>bever hat</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. "Has <i>Cosmopoli</i> been ever appropriated to any known
locality?"&mdash;John Jebb, p. 213.</p>
<p>Cosmopolis has been used for London, and for Paris (G. Peignot,
<i>R&eacute;pertoire de bibliographies sp&eacute;ciales</i>, Paris,
1810. 8&deg;. pp. 116, 132.) It may also, in accordance with its
etymology, be used for Amsterdam, or Berlin, or Calcutta, etc. As
an imprint, it takes the dative case. The <i>Interpretationes
paradox&aelig; quatuor evangeliorum</i> of Sandius, were printed at
Amsterdam. (M. Weiss, <i>Biographie universelle</i>, Paris, 1811
28. 8&deg;. xl. 312.)</p>
<p>3. References to "any works or treatises supplying information
on the history of the Arabic numerals" are requested by "E.N." p.
230.</p>
<p>To the well chosen works enumberated by the querist, I shall add
the titles of two valuable publications in my own collection:</p>
<p>DICTIONNAIRE RAISONN&Eacute; DE DIPLOMATIQUE&mdash;par dom de
Vaines. <i>Paris</i>, 1774. 8&deg;. 2 vol.</p>
<p>EL&Eacute;MENTS DE PAL&Eacute;OGRAPHIE, par M. Natalis de
Wailly. <i>Paris</i>, Imprimerie royale, 1838. 4&deg;. 2 vol.</p>
<p>The former work is a convenient epitome of the <i>Nouveau
trait&eacute; de diplomatique</i>. The latter is a new compilation,
undertaken with the sanction of M. Guizot. Its appearance was thus
hailed by the learned Daunou: "Cet ouvrage nous semble
recommandable par l'exactitude des recherches, par la distribution
m&eacute;thodique des mati&egrave;res et par
l'&eacute;l&eacute;gante pr&eacute;cision du style." (<i>Journal
des savants</i>, Paris, 1838. 4&deg;. p. 328.)</p>
<p>A query should always be worded with care, and put in a
<i>quotable</i> shape. The observance of this plain rule would
economise space, save the time which might otherwise be occupied in
useless research, and tend to produce more pertinency of reply. The
first and second of the above queries may serve as models.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Old Auster Tenement</i> (No. 14. p. 217.).&mdash;I think that
I am in a condition to throw some light on the meaning of this
expression, noticed in a former Number by "W.P.P." The tenements
held in villenage of the lord of a manor, at least where they
consisted of a messuage or dwelling-house, are often called
<i>astra</i> in our older books and court-rolls. If the tenement
was an ancient one, it was <i>vetus</i> or <i>antiquum astrum</i>;
if a tenure of recent creation (or a new-take, as it is called in
some manors), it was <i>novum astrum</i>. The villenage tenant of
it was an <i>astrarius</i>. "W.P.P." may satisfy himself of these
facts by referring to the printed <i>Plautorum Abbrevietis</i>, fo.
282.; to Fleta, <i>Comment. Juris. Anglicani</i>, ed. 1685, p.
217.; and to Ducange, Spelman, and Cowel, under the words "Astrum,"
"Astrarius," and "Astre." In the very locality to which "W.P.P."
refers, he will find that the word "Auster" is "Astrum" in the
oldest court-rolls, and that the term is not confined to North
Curry, but is very prevalent in the eastern half of Somerset. At
the present day, an <i>auster</i> tenement is a species of
copyhold, with all the incidents to that tenure. It is noticed in
the Journal of the Arch&aelig;ological Institute, in a recent
critique on Dr. Evans's Leicestershire words, and is very familar
to legal practitioners of any experience in the district alluded
to.</p>
<p class="author">E. Smirke.</p>
<p><i>Tureen</i> (No. 16. p. 246.).&mdash;There is properly no such
word. It is a corruption of the French <i>terrine</i>, an earthen
vessel in which soup is served. It is in Bailey's Dictionary. I
take this opportunity of suggesting whether that the word
"<i>swinging</i>," applied by Goldsmith to his tureen, should be
rather spelt <i>swingeing</i>; though the former is the more usual
way: a <i>swinging</i> dish and a <i>swingeing</i> are different
things, and Goldsmith meant the latter.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id=
"page308"></a>{308}</span>
<p><i>Burning the Dead.</i>&mdash;"T." will find some information
on this subject in Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Hydriotaphia</i>, chap.
i., which appears to favour his view except in the following
extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The same practice extended also far west, and besides
Heruleans, Getes and Thracians, was in use with most of the
Celt&aelig;, Sarmatians, Germans, Gauls, Danes, Swedes, Norwegians;
not to omit some use thereof among <i>Carthaginians</i>, and
<i>Americans</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Carthaginians most probably received the custom from their
ancestors the Phoenicians, but where did the Americans get it?</p>
<p class="author">Henry St. Chad.</p>
<p>Corpus Christi Hall, Maidstone, Feb. 8. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Burning the Dead.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent "T." (No. 14.
p. 216.) can hardly have overlooked the case of Dido, in his
inquiry "whether the practice of burning the dead has ever been in
vogue amongst any people, excepting the inhabitants of Europe and
Asia?" According to all classical authorities, Dido was founder and
queen of Carthage in <i>Africa</i>, and was burned at Carthage on a
funeral pile.</p>
<p>If it be said that Dido's corpse underwent burning in conformity
with the custom of her native country Tyre, and not because it
obtained in the land of her adoption, then the question arises,
whether burning the dead was not one of the customs which the
Tyrian colony of Dido imported into Africa, and became permanently
established at Carthage. It is very certain that the Carthaginians
had human sacrifices by fire, and that they burned their children
in the furnace to Saturn.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>
<p><i>M. de Gournay.</i>&mdash;The author of the axioms <i>Laissez
faire, laissez passer</i>, which are the sum and substance of the
free trade principles of political economy, and perhaps the
pithiest and completest exposition of the doctrine of a particular
school ever made, was Jean Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay, who was
born at St. Malo in 1712, and died at Paris in 1759. In early life
he was engaged in trade, and subsequently became Honorary
Councillor of the Grand Council, and Honorary Intendant of
Commerce. He translated, in 1742, Josiah Child's <i>Considerations
on Commerce and on the Interest on Money</i>, and Culpepper's
treatise <i>Against Usury</i>. He also wrote a good deal on
questions of political economy. He was, in fact, with Dr. Quesnay,
the chief of the French economists of the last century; but he was
more liberal than Quesnay in his doctrines; indeed he is (far more
than Adam Smith) the virtual founder of the modern school of
political economy; and yet, perhaps, of all the economists he is
the least known!</p>
<p>The great Turgot was a friend and ardent admirer of M. de
Gournay; and on his death wrote a pompous <i>Eloge</i> on him.</p>
<p class="author">A Man in a Garret.</p>
<p><i>Cupid Crying.</i>&mdash;"Our readers will remember that some
time since (<i>ant&egrave;</i>, p. 108.) we copied into our
columns, from the 'Notes and Queries,' an epigram of great elegance
on the subject of 'Cupid Crying;' the contributor of which was
desirous of finding through that medium, especially established for
such discoveries, the original text and the name of its author.
Subsequently, a correspondent of our own [<i>ant&egrave;</i>, p.
132.] volunteered a translation by himself, in default of the
original. The correspondent of the 'Notes and Queries' has now
stumbled on what he sought, and is desirous that we should transmit
it to the author of the volunteer version, with his thanks. This we
take the present means of doing. Under the signature of 'Rufus,' he
writes as follows:&mdash;'In a MS. book, long missing, I find the
following copy, with a reference to <i>Car. Illust. Poet. Ital.</i>
vol. i. 229, wherein it is ascribed to Antonio Tebaldeo&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since printing this communication from 'Rufus' we have received
the same original (with the variation of a single
word&mdash;<i>quid</i> for <i>cur</i> in the opening of the
epigram) from a German correspondent at Augsburgh. 'You will find
it,' he says, 'in the <i>Anthologia Latina Burmanniana</i>, iii.
236, or in the new edition of this <i>Latin Anthology</i>, by Henry
Meyer, Lipsi&aelig;, 1835, tom. ii. page 139, No. 1566. The author
of the epigram is doubtful, but the diction appears rather too
quaint for a good ancient writer. Maffei ascribes it to Brenzoni,
who lived in the sixteenth century; others give it to Ant.
Tebaldeo, of Ferrara.' Our readers will perceive that the
translator has taken some liberties with his text. 'Lumine
form&aelig; deceptus,' for instance, is not translated by 'she
smiled.' But it may be questioned if the suggestion is not even
more delicate and graceful in the translator's version than in the
original."&mdash;<i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>

<p><i>Journeyman.</i>&mdash;Three or four years since, a paragraph
went the round of the press, deriving the English word "journeyman"
from the custom of travelling among work-men in Germany. This
derivation is very doubtful. Is it not a relic of Norman rule, from
the French <i>journ&eacute;e</i>, signifying a day-man? In support
of this it may be observed, that the German name for the word in
question if <i>Tagel&ouml;hner</i>, or day-worker. It is also well
known, that down to a comparatively recent period, artisans and
free labourers were paid daily.</p>
<p class="author">Gomer.</p>
<p><i>Balloons.</i>&mdash;In one of your early numbers you mention
the <i>History of Ringwood</i>, &amp;c. Many years since I sent to
a periodical (I cannot recollect which) a circumstance connected
with that town, which I never heard or read of anywhere, and which,
as it is rather of importance, I forward to you in hopes that some
of your correspondents may be able to throw some light upon it.
When my father was in the Artillery Ground at the ascension of
Lunardi's balloon, he remarked to several persons present, "This is
no novelty to <i>me</i>; I remember well, when I was at school in
Ringwood [about the year 1757], an apothecary in that town that
used to let off <i>balloons</i> (he had no other name, I suppose,
to give them) on a smaller scale, but exactly corresponding with
what he then saw, <i>many</i> a time."</p>
<p>I had several letters addressed to me, requesting further
explanation, which, as my father was dead, I was unable to give. It
is highly improbable that any persons now living may have it in
their power to corroborate the fact, but some of their relations or
descendants may. I suppose they must have been
<i>fire-balloons</i>, and these of the rudest construction; and my
father, being a boy at the time, would have given perhaps little
valuable information, except as to the name of the apothecary,
which, however, I never heard him mention.</p>

<p>MEMOIRS OF MUSICK. By the Hon. ROGER NORTH, Attorney-General to

&amp;c. Quarto; with a Portrait; handsomely printed in 4to.;
half-bound in morocco, 15<i>s.</i></p>
<p>This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney in
the course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed at the
disposal of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society, by
George Townshend Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral. But
the Council, not feeling authorised to commence a series of
literary publications, yet impressed with the value of the work,
have suggested its independent publication to their Secretary, Dr.
Rimbault, under whose editorial care it accordingly appears.</p>
<p>It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek Fables
respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of Musical
Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our present
fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's Opera,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
